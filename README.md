# SDG Apps Privacy Policy

SDG Apps is committed to honoring its users' privacy.  We are a small, indie development organization; currently we neither own nor rent any servers.  This makes it trivially easy to manage user data privacy, since it naturally implies that we don't have the ability to store any user's data to begin with.  However, if at any time we decide to host a server (e.g. to allow users to sync their data to the cloud), we will update this policy accordingly.

## Ads

Currently, this is an entirely **pro bono** operation.  The main developer has his own means of income, and puts these apps together largely from personal hobby interest and use cases.  Thus, there is no cost for the use of any of the apps, nor any ads to keep them afloat.  We won't even ask for donations :)

## Audience

None of the SDG apps are targeted at any particular age range or demographic.  No crude graphics or anything below family-friendly content will be added.  Most of the apps are largely text-based.

## Enjoy!

We at SDG Apps hope you enjoy using these tools.  Feel free to reach out to the developer at nabond251@gmail.com with any questions, comments, complaints, or concerns.

Soli Deo Gloria - to God alone be the glory
